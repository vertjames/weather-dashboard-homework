# Weather Dashboard Homework

## Task

In this exercise, we were tasked with building a weather dashboard using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.


## Process

I used Geocode.xyz API to turn entered city name into lat & lon, then used that in OpenWeatherMap's one-call API to generate all the data, which populates the different elements on the page. 

Here is how the app appears in-browser:

## Status

This assigment is in progress. I still have to get local storage to saved the searched-for cities so they can be recalled, and I'm also having inconsistency issues with Geocode.xyz's API (it's throwing 403 Forbidden warnings).
